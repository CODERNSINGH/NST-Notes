# Today Target is sets
* more notes from : (https://goalkicker.com/)

**Sets**: is an unorderd pairs and mutable elements are `unique` and its pairs of well defined Numbers/or Something 

*Example* ```{value1}```

* **Note**: sometimes it reurn in orderd but don't trust on that it just randomly do that shit


**Build in Function** 
1. `s.add()` : add new element in Sets
2. `s.update()` : add multiple elements in list
3. `s.remove(element)` : direct remove element from set if not exist throw Key error
4. `s.discard` : removes elements and not Give error Updated version of `s.remove(element)`
5. `s.pop()` : when it delete something and Return what is it deleted and removes elements Randomly since we Have unorderd
